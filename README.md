Welcome to 21 Vice!

A fairly spicy Blackjack Game with an 80's theme .

IMPORTANT: This game requires at least two screens to play (or interpid users handling nultiple browser windows at the same time). Supports up to Four Players.

The development team recommends use of the firefox browser. All other browsers work, but the experience is slightly less premier
(think more 8 out of 10 than 10 out of 10 in awesomeness. Still pretty awesome.)

Steps to get going:

1. Navigate to twenty-one-dice.herokuapp.com to get things going!
2. After navigating to the page - click "Let's Play" to start.
3. On the largest screen (or whatever screen you want to serve as your Blackjack Table), click "Create A Table".
4. Each player who intends to take part should navigate to the aforementioned page (twenty-one-dice.herokuapp.com) on the device of their choice.
5. After clicking "Let's Play" , Click join. You're In!
6. Click the chips to choose what you want to bet - then click ready to get the game ready!

Important Note: Don't let anyone else join after you start. The game will break (Leaderboards button doesnt do anything either). We are still jr devs... it happens. Will update this when we fix it (if we fix it haha).

7.  Hit.. Stay.. it's Blackjack! Try and get to 21 to win, or score higher than the dealer.
8.  Between rounds, click spin to get a modifier! Your the modifier you receive can be added to your hand in subsequent rounds.
9.  This one is the most important... Have Fun! If things break, click the 21Vice logo on the top right corner of the table and everything will reset (on all screens.)

Thanks for playing our game.

Love,
21-Vice Team

Also - a shout out to all the other black jack apps out there on the web. A lot of devs have spent a lot of time making Blackjack apps and a lot of those apps served as inspiration and education for the work we did. Thank you for building the foundation from which we stood off of. Same to the instructors and TA's who answered the many questions we asked. You made the struggle easier, but not too easy.
